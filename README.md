# ðŸŽ¯ Real-Time Object Detection & Direction Tracking

This project uses **OpenCV** and **HSV color filtering** to detect and track colored objects in real time using a webcam. It also provides direction feedback like **Left**, **Right**, or **Stop** based on the objectâ€™s position and distance from the camera.

## ðŸ§ª Tools Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- imutils  
- Webcam

## ðŸ“Š Sample Output

**Input:**  
Live webcam feed detecting a red-colored object  
**Output:**  
Overlayed tracking circle + Direction text (e.g., `Direction: Right`)  

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Run `object_detection.py` to calibrate HSV values using sliders
2. Adjust HSV until the object is correctly highlighted in the **Mask**
3. Update those HSV values in `object_detection_output.py`
4. Run `object_detection_output.py` to track object and view direction output
5. Press `q` to quit the window

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Concepts

- HSV color space filtering  
- Real-time webcam feed processing  
- Noise reduction (blurring, erosion, dilation)  
- Contour detection and shape tracking  
- Direction logic based on object size and position
